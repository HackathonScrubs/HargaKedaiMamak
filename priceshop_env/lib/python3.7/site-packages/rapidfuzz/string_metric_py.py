def levenshtein(s1, s2, *, weights=(1, 1, 1), processor=None, max=None):
    """
    Calculates the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions
    required to change one sequence into the other according to Levenshtein with custom
    costs for insertion, deletion and substitution

    Parameters
    ----------
    s1 : Sequence[Hashable]
        First string to compare.
    s2 : Sequence[Hashable]
        Second string to compare.
    weights : Tuple[int, int, int] or None, optional
        The weights for the three operations in the form
        (insertion, deletion, substitution). Default is (1, 1, 1),
        which gives all three operations a weight of 1.
    processor: callable, optional
        Optional callable that is used to preprocess the strings before
        comparing them. Default is None, which deactivates this behaviour.
    max : int or None, optional
        Maximum distance between s1 and s2, that is
        considered as a result. If the distance is bigger than max,
        max + 1 is returned instead. Default is None, which deactivates
        this behaviour.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : int
        distance between s1 and s2

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If unsupported weights are provided a ValueError is thrown

    .. deprecated:: 2.0.0
        Use :func:`rapidfuzz.distance.Levenshtein.distance` instead.
        This function will be removed in v3.0.0.

    Examples
    --------
    Find the Levenshtein distance between two strings:

    >>> from rapidfuzz.string_metric import levenshtein
    >>> levenshtein("lewenstein", "levenshtein")
    2

    Setting a maximum distance allows the implementation to select
    a more efficient implementation:

    >>> levenshtein("lewenstein", "levenshtein", max=1)
    2

    It is possible to select different weights by passing a `weight`
    tuple.
